# PySys

Hello! Thanks for checking out my script!
To run it, you will need to have python installed. If you dont, install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) by clicking on 'Download Python {version}'.
After you did that, run the .bat file and it should be working fine!
If you move the .bat or the .py file, it won't work, they have to be in the same folder. [If you know a bit of coding you could maybe make a shortcut from your desktop]
